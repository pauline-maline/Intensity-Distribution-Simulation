Intensity distribution simulation is Python code that lets the user simulate the expected received power of any object with a knwon radar cross section as a function of distance and height from a radar setup (radar and clutter shielding fence).
In the first part of the code, the user should insert the values of paremeters for the specific radar setup. The default values are an example for an X-band radar with a slotted waveguide antenna.
One the parameters are inserted, the code will calculate the intensity distribution and make a plot.
